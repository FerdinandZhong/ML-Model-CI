# Web Portal of ML Model CI

## Quick Start

Before getting start with the web application, you need to connect with your backend APIs (MLModelCI services). Currently, the address is hardcoded as `localhost:5000`. If you want to connect to your own MLModelCI service, you should modify the address before starting.

```bash
npm install
npm start
```
