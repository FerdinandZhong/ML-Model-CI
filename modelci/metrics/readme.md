# Metric

Here are some metrics of model performance.

- [CAdvisor Client](./cadvisor): monitor for model docker containers.
- [Throughput and Latency](./benchmark): throughput and latency test for a specific model.
- [Monetary Cost](./monetary): Monetary cost of machines (GPU, CPU) per unit time.

## Roadmap

- [ ] Profile local model performance

- [ ] Profile containerized model performance
